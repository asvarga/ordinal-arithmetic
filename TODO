LEARNED
- "not a subtype of Required type VV : {VV : GHC.Prim.Addr# | 5 < 4}" indicates a totality issue
- LH doesn't know that: compOrd x y == op (compOrd y x) where (op LT = GT) etc.
	- also: compOrd x y == EQ -> x == y
- it's easier to work case by case from the outside before doing the below




General Proving Strategy
- Manually expand terms with equational reasoning
- Turn certain terms t into (t === s) or (t ==? s ? P)
- When some "? P" is used multiple times, raise it to some location where it can be reused with a "let evidence = P in" or "let evidence = (evidence &&& P) in"


f x = case x of
	one y -> t1 ==? True ? P
	zero y -> t2 ==? True ? P
